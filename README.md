# NHL-ranker-for-Tims-Challenge

---
## Description

The Tim Hortons Hockey Challenge is an app where users are given 3 lists of hockey players everyday, in which they select a player from each list. If a selected player scores that day, the user earns points, which can be redeemed for Tim Hortons goods!

The goal of this project is to automate the daily selection of players using a ranking system based on stats pulled from an NHL API (https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi). The code should also be able to interact with the Tim Hortons app to grab game schedules and player selection lists, as well as submit picks, all without user input.
