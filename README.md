# NHL-ranker-for-Tims-Challenge
The Tim Hortons Hockey Challenge is an app where users are given 3 lists of hockey players everyday, in which they select a player from each list. If a selected player scores, the user earns points, which can be redeemed for Tim Hortons goods!

This python program is used to obtain data about the players playing each day and rank them based on different stats. This gives the user an organized platform to view player stats in order to make the informed selections. The program scrapes hockey player, game, and schedule data from the NHL API in JSON format. The data is then organized in player and team classes to use in sorting by different stats.
